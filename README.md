## How the files are organized

[Blade folder](https://github.com/ProtonKicker/Team-22/tree/main/Blade) is for the blade files we made ealier on: like the blades

[Tower folder](https://github.com/ProtonKicker/Team-22/tree/main/Tower) inlcudes everything we made after the blades. Including motor mockup and motor housing

[Reference folder](https://github.com/ProtonKicker/Team-22/tree/main/Reference%20File) are just references. Nothing we made are in there

<ins> **The final design stays in the main directory**  </ins>
